    "# Bayesian Inference in FSharp\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For my F# Advent submission this year, I decided to implement an extremely simple Bayesian Statistical Framework to be used for inference. The purpose of statistical inference is to infer characteristics of a population via samples to be used for further tasks such as making predictions. The \"Bayesian\" prefix refers to making use of the Bayes Theorem to conduct inferential statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](./Images/StatisticalInference.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "I like to think of Statistical Inference via a pasta boiling analogy: hypothetically, assume you lose the cooking instructions of dried pasta you are trying to cook. You start boiling the water and don't know when the pasta is al-dente. One way to check is to careful remove a single piece and test if it is cooked to your liking. Through this process, you'll know right away if the pasta needs to cook more or is ready to be sauce'd up. Similarly, inference deals with trying to figure out characteristics (__is the pasta ready?__) of a population (__all the pasta__) via a sample (__a single piece of pasta__).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "F#, as a language, didn't fail to deliver an awesome development experience! The particular aspects of the language that made it easy to develop a Bayesian Statistical Framework are [Pattern Matching](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/pattern-matching), [Functional Domain Drive Design](\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "I recently received a Masters in Data Science but discovered that none of my courses dove deep into Bayesian Statistics. Therefore, motivated by a penchant desire to fully understand the differences between frequentist approaches and Bayesian ones to eventually gain an understanding of Bayesian Neural Networks was the impetus behind trying to understand the statistical theory. \n",
    "\n",
    "While reading  [\"A First Course in Bayesian Statistical Methods\"](https://www.amazon.com/Bayesian-Statistical-Methods-Springer-Statistics/dp/1441928286/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3D7COZ06U9AU1&dchild=1&keywords=a+first+course+in+bayesian+statistical+methods&qid=1608705310&sprefix=A+first+course+in+baye%2Caps%2C239&sr=8-2) by Peter Hoff (highly recommend this book to those with a strong mathematical background), I discovered [pymc3](https://docs.pymc.io/), a Probabilistic Programming library in Python. Pymc3, in my opinion, has some great abstractions that I wanted to implement myself in a functional-first setting. \n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to learn a new statistical algorithm is my implementing it and the best way to learn something well is to teach it to others and hence, this submission is a result of that ideology. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Bayes Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "The crux of Bayesian Inference lies in making use of the Bayes Theorem whose formula is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$p(\\theta \\mid y) = \\frac{p(y \\mid \\theta) p(\\theta)}{p(y)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "| Term           | Formula | Definition  |\n",
    "| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: |\n",
    "|  Prior         |  $p(\\theta)$  | Quantification of t   |  |\n",
    "| Likelihood     | $p(y \\mid \\theta)$ | In light of observations,  | | |\n",
    "| Evidence       | $p(y)$ | The normalizing constant so that the probability is between 0 and 1. |\n",
    "| Posterior      | $p(\\theta \\mid y)$ |  | | |\n",
    "\n",
    "The premise of the interpretation of Bayes Theorem that resonates most with the scientific method is that you first come up with a hypothesis (prior), you figure out the likelihood that the hypothesis is valid based on available evidence and then quantify the validity of the hypothesis by highlighting the level of associated uncertainty. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bayesian Inference in Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the denominator or the evidence i.e. the normalization constant of the Bayes theorem is a pain to calculate. For example, for continuous variables, Bayes theorem has the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$p(\\theta \\mid y) = \\frac{p(y \\mid \\theta) p(\\theta)}{\\int_{\\Theta}p(y \\mid \\tilde{\\theta}) p(\\tilde{\\theta}) \\; d\\tilde{\\theta}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "That integral is UGLY and sometimes computational infeasible and so, approximation techniques must be used to get to generate the posterior distribution : enter __Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)__ methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo  = Random Number Generation; you \n",
    "Markov-Chain = The future only depends on the present, not the past. Linked list of approximations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals of this submission are to develop the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __A Bayesian Domain Specific Language (DSL)__ that a statistician with no programming experience can understand and use to specify a model and its parameters and code that parses the model.\n",
    "2. A way to represent the Bayesian DSL as a Bayesian Network addressing the simplest case i.e. one prior and one likelihood.\n",
    "3. An algorithm that makes use of the Bayesian DSL representation to approximate the posterior distribution.\n",
